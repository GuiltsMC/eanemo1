        Ean has been like this for over 54 years. Through extensive therapy at the "Emo Recovery Center" it may be able to be treated but for now... he may never be the same... :(

        Chapter 2: Rainbow Six Siege
    </h2>

    <p class="classicText">
        Whenever little boy Ean Biqilious Thomas III was rejected by the women I previously mentioned and transforming into the Emo he is today, he started playing Rainbow Six Siege (or as it is medically referred to as, "Terminal Mega Cancer"). The only problem is, he sux ass at this game. So whenever he plays, he gets super  sad because he's so bad and gets headshot sniped at the start of every single round.
